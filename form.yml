      How many processor cores you need; a value of 0 requests the
      maximum number of cores allowable on Katana.
  memory:

    step: 1
    help: >-
      How much memory you need.  Many Ansys jobs need 3-4GB per processor
      core.

      If the amount of memory you request goes over certain thresholds,
      it will affect your wait time.  The points at which this happens
      are 124, 180, 248, 370, 750 and 1000 GB.
